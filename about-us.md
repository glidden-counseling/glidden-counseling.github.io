### Jarae Swanstrom

Do you struggle with overwhelming feelings of anxiety or depression related to your weight or negative body image? Have you tried everything to lose weight but can’t seem to sustain the weight loss? Maybe you’ve succeeded in your weight loss efforts but then find that the weight creeps back up over time? Perhaps you struggle to control your eating habits or use food to cope with your emotions? Have you been told by a doctor that you have a chronic disease or that you need to make some lifestyle changes to improve your health? If this sounds familiar, know that you are not alone.

Many of us navigate life on autopilot, unaware that our current challenges are deeply rooted in childhood experiences. This cycle can be broken, and I am here to support you. I specialize in helping women overcome anxiety and depression associated with weight gain, negative body image, emotional eating, and chronic disease. As a Licensed Professional Counselor and Clinical Exercise Physiologist, I help women break free from the negative cycles that bind them so that they can reduce their anxious or depressive symptoms and achieve permanent weight loss.

My goal is to empower women to reconnect with their bodies and regain control over their behaviors, allowing them to fully embrace the present moments in life. I work with women to identify their unhelpful coping skills, regulate their nervous system, transform their relationship with food, foster a positive mindset, and cultivate new habits for a sustained, long-term approach to physical and mental health.
