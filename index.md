We all struggle in life, but many people feel uncomfortable pursuing therapy because of the stigma associated with it. People may fear that asking for help is a sign of weakness or indicates a serious mental health issue. In reality, seeking support is an indication of strength, health, and resilience. Whether this is your first time seeking a therapist or you are returning to therapy, in my practice you can discuss issues openly and we will work collaboratively to resolve conflicts and develop confidence. 
 
Whatever your reason for seeking therapy my approach is to help you confront rather than avoid problems. My approach is driven by empathy, strength, trust, and understanding without judgment. Rather than approaching every case in the same manner and the same therapeutic orientation, I choose to draw on a wide range of theories, methods, and practices in order to tailor our sessions to your personal needs.
 
I am a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor, a north Idaho native and am also nationally certified in Trauma Focused-CBT. My primary clinical interest is working with adolescents, teenagers, adults, families, and couples. I am available for consultation and am also a state registered supervisor for therapists that require supervision. Common issues in my practice include anxiety/depression, coupleâ€™s issues, sexuality, suicidality, LGBT issues, and life transitions (including relationships, work, and grief).
 
Therapy can seem like a scary step, it is hard to acknowledge you are in a place in life where you need help and support. Together, we will carefully explore your challenges and find a way to move forward.
