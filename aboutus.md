About Us
	
../images/lake.jpg

I am a Licensed Clinical Professional Counselor, a north Idaho native and am also nationally certified in Trauma Focused-CBT. My primary clinical interest is working with adolescents, teenagers, adults, families, and couples. I am available for consultation and am also a state registered supervisor for therapists that require supervision. Common issues in my practice include anxiety/depression, coupleâ€™s issues, sexuality, suicidality, LGBT issues, and life transitions (including relationships, work, and grief)
